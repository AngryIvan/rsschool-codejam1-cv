        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>I wanted to be a developer ever since I saw my cousin working in this sphere when I was about 8 years old. </p>
        <p>While I was on my third year in college my groupmates got me into front-end. I really enjoyed this sphere and worked on some projects. </p>
        <p>Later for my diploma I worked on back-end using Django which I also really enjoyed. That’s why I feel that I might try full stack one day</p>
        <p>I like developing so much I stay up to 4AM sometimes. It was fascinating for me to create something and see the result of my work. Resolving issues and fixing bugs is a part of a process, which I don’t mind, because it means that there is a progress.</p>
        <p>I tried learning by myself, but felt like it was hard for me to learn without some kind of relevant program, which got me to apply for Rolling Scopes School.</p>
